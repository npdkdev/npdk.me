        <p>I am a software engineer focused on frontend development. I can describe my self as a designer who trapped in the mind of a programmer, I love building modern and beautiful app.

          I was born and raised in Jakarta, then moved to Bandung and currently based on Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Currently I study Informatics Engineering in Amikom Yogyakarta.

          Started programming since graduated from highschool learning html, css and PHP. Introduced to javascript when I want to create a mobile app using React native, Yes I learn React native before understanding javascript first haha, then fall in love with React since then.</p>
